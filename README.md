## Features

- **Face Detection:** This code can spot faces like a hawk, ensuring no one is left without a pair of glass.
- **Automatic Sizing:** It resizes the sunglasses to fit each face perfectly, because one size doesn't fit all (except for coolness).
- **Alpha Channel Support:** Transparency? No problem! The code handles alpha channels like a pro.
- **Multi-Face Support:** Got a group photo? The code will make sure everyone looks equally cool.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

- A good sense of humor (optional, but highly recommended)
